# TopDownPlatformer_GMS

When creating a top down platformer, so much of the look and feel requires the right kind of sprites. You can't use normal sprites, they must be created
with a top-down nature, 3D space, in mind. Notice how the player the solids all have half of their sprites darkened, to indicate the front. That is essential
for maintaining how you view and interact with them.
